# Multi_Conditioned_Text_Generation
Conditional Text Generation using GPT-2 with multiple conditioning channels : Titles, Verdicts and Anchors. Final Project for Applied NLP at USC.

# Introduction
In this project, we attempt to improve conditioned
neural story generation. Specifically, given a title
and a verdict, the task of our neural model is to
generate a short, coherent first-person story that is
not only consistent with the title but also adheres
to the verdict. The verdict label chosen can either
be one that sheds a positive or negative light on the
narrator.

## Novel Contributions

- we propose a neural text generation system that
generates short compelling narratives conditioned
on a title,verdict pair. A verdict provides a diversifying
‘seed’ and supplements text generation with
additional context and direction.

- Additionally, we use an anchor-based
approach for gaining control and ensuring event
coherence in the generated text.
